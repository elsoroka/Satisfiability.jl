# Contributing

You can contribute to Satisfiability.jl! (Yes, even if you've never made an open source contribution before.)

## Getting started
* Please make sure to follow the [Julia community standards](https://julialang.org/community/standards) in all interactions.
* Here's a [guide to making your first pull request](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/exploring-projects-on-github/contributing-to-a-project)
* Here's some more Julia-specific tips by Katharine Hyatt on [Making your first Julia pull request](https://kshyatt.github.io/post/firstjuliapr/).
* If you're not sure how to fix the bug or add the feature you're interested in (or not sure how it fits into our roadmap), **start an issue to discuss it**.

## What should I work on?
If you want to contribute, but aren't sure where to begin:

* Look for issues tagged [good first issue](https://github.com/elsoroka/Satisfiability.jl/labels/good%20first%20issue).

* Help add more examples to our [documentation](https://elsoroka.github.io/Satisfiability.jl/dev/) or improve the documentation itself.
